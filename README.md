# About me
Hello, I am Adrian. I am here on GitHub because I want to set out on my new career path. Previously I worked as a chimney sweep but also ran the office and did the accountancy. Now I am learning Manual Testing on a course which helps me take my first steps in that new profession. In the future I would like to work as a Tester.

Any opportunity to improve my qualifications gives me a lot of motivation. That is why I am looking for a creative place where I could develop my new skills. Working as a chimney sweep, I learnt to enjoy talking to people. I am a good team player but, if needed, I am also happy to work on my own. Working in the office required accuracy, which I can use in the manual tester profession, where attention to detail is the key. 

My ambition encourages me to improve myself. I am creative and open to new experiences as I have a wide range of interests, from snowboarding to roller skating. I also appreciate handcrafts. My manual skills allow me to fulfill myself artistically. Sometimes it is a drawing. Sometimes it is a wooden table. And sometimes
a concrete flower pot. I would like to learn horse riding to roam forests like Gerald on his Roach. 

All in all, I am open to people and the world.
