# About me
Hello, I am Adrian. I want to set out on my new career path. 

Previously I worked as a chimney sweep. Now I am learning Manual Testing. Any opportunity to improve my qualifications gives me a lot of motivation. That is why I am looking for a creative place where I could develop my new skills. I am a good team player but, if needed, I am also happy to work on my own. I am creative and open to new experiences as I have a wide range of interests. My manual skills allow me to fulfill myself artistically. 

All in all, I am open to people and the world.
